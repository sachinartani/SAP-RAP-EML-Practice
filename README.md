## üõ†Ô∏è What's Inside This Repository?

You get two distinct RAP applications, allowing you to master both modern ABAP development paradigms.

| Application Type | Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- |
| üë®‚Äçüíª **Unmanaged Application** | Core RAP principles, custom logic, handler methods, and full control over the transaction. |
| ü§ñ **Managed Application** | Framework power, late numbering, determinations, validations, and custom actions. |

<br/>

## üéØ What You Will Master

By using these applications, you will get hands-on experience with:
- ‚úÖ **CRUD-Q Operations:** `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and custom `ACTIONS`.
- ‚úÖ **Complex Data Models:** Deep creates, multi-level associations, and compositions.
- ‚úÖ **Transactional Integrity:** Using `FAILED` and `REPORTED` to handle errors gracefully.
- ‚úÖ **Modern ABAP Workflow:** Using `abapGit` and working within the `SAP BTP ABAP Environment`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up your practice lab:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Use `abapGit` to pull this repository into your SAP BTP ABAP Environment or on-premise S/4HANA system. (Need help? Follow my guide on [setting up abapGit](https://sachinartani.com/blog/pull-abap-objects-from-github-to-sap-btp-abap)).
2.  **Activate All Objects:** Once the objects are pulled, make sure to activate all of them to ensure the applications are ready to run.
3.  **Activate the Service Bindings:** Activate the service binding for each of the two RAP applications.
4.  **Start Coding!** Preview the apps to see how they work, then open up your favorite EML editor and start tackling the challenges from the [Practice Kit](https://topmate.io/sachin_artani/1757486).
